# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This is a young project under active development. We aim to keep the `main` branch secure.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, use GitHub's private reporting feature:

- Navigate to the repository "Security" tab and select "Report a vulnerability"
- Provide a detailed description and steps to reproduce

We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and work on a fix as soon as possible. Once resolved, we will coordinate a disclosure.

If the private reporting feature is unavailable, open a new draft security advisory or contact the maintainers via a private channel.

## Scope

The `desktop-app` binary and WASM execution host are in scope. Third-party WASM modules are out of scope unless explicitly provided by this repository.
