# Progress

## Working (per docs)
- Desktop app MCP server with Wasmtime; dynamic tool discovery; TOML config; stdio/TCP modes; local module loading
- Test module with `add`, URL validation, and response processing

## To Validate Now
- README quick start works without changes
- tools/list and tools/call work for `add`, `validate_url`, and `fetch`
- Claude Desktop integration via stdio

## Known Gaps / Next Enhancements
- HTTP module source + caching with SHA-256
- More function patterns; improved error handling; hot-reload (dev)
