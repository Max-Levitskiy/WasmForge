# Active Context

## Current Focus (VAN)
- OSS readiness: add licenses, community health files, CI, and dependency updates.

## Next Steps (immediate)
- Ensure CI builds both crates (wasm + desktop) on nightly Rust
- Add badges/links in `README.md`; iterate on CONTRIBUTING as needed

## Notes
- Desktop app appears feature-complete per docs; CI focuses on build/lint for now.
